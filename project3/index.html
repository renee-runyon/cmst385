        <h3>Composer, Educator, Grammy Winner, and Creator of P.D.Q. Bach</h3>

        <p>
          Peter Schickele was an American composer, musical satirist, Juilliard alum, and perhaps best known for creating the fictional composer, P.D.Q. Bach. His work often features odd instruments not typically used by a traditional symphony orchestra, like slide whistles, kazoos, and balloons.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with all the fun and silliness, Schickele was an accomplished composer of many serious works. He wrote the score for the science fiction film <em>Silent Running</em> and for the broadway musical <em>Oh! Calcutta!</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>His concerts were fun and enjoyable for all audiences, whether they had any training in music or not.</p>
