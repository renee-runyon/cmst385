<h3>Overview</h3>

<!-- At least two strong tags - STRONG #1 -->
<p>
  For my final project, I propose to design and build a <strong>professional portfolio website</strong> that features my work, skills, education, and experience in web development and design.
  The website will present my projects in a clear, organized format that is easy to navigate. It is important that the site is visually appealing, especially to potential employers and clients.

  The website will use a clean, professional layout with consistent design across all pages.

  The main content area will be centered on the page with appropriate spacing and readable typography.
