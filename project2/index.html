<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<p>
  This proposal outlines my plan and my goals for my Final Project website.
  The purpose of this proposal is to describe the purpose of the website, define its intended structure, and identify the resources I will use.
</p>

<h2>1. Project Concept</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
  For my final project, I intend to build a <strong>personal blog website</strong> that is designed to share written content,
  images, and commentary on a variety of topics including technology, daily observations, and general interests.
  The website will present content in a clear, organized format that is easy to navigate and visually consistent.
</p>

<h4>Objectives and Goals</h4>

<p>
  The primary goals of the website are to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a clean and readable platform for blog-style content</li>
  <li>Organize posts into logical sections for easy browsing</li>
  <li>Provide visitors with information about the author and a way to make contact</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The intended audience includes readers interested in <em>personal writing</em>, <em>technology-related topics</em>,
  and informal blog-style commentary.
</p>

<p>
  Planned features for the website include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog post listings with excerpts</li>
  <li>Individual post pages</li>
  <li>Simple navigation menu</li>
  <li>Contact form or email link</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some features may be <u>non-functional prototypes</u> for the purpose of this class project.

  The website content will be organized into five primary pages. Navigation links will be available

<ul>
  <li>Home</li>

  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

<h4>Layout and Navigation</h4>

<p>
  The website will use a standard layout with a header at the top containing the site title and navigation menu.
  The main content area will be centered on the page, with a footer displayed at the bottom.

<h2>4. Project Resources</h2>

<h3>Development Resources</h3>

<p>
  One resource that will help complete this project is
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML" target="_blank">
    MDN Web Docs – HTML Basics
  </a>.
</p>

<p>
  This resource provides clear documentation and examples for HTML structure, semantic tags,
  and best practices. It will be used to ensure that all HTML elements are coded correctly and
  follow web standards.
